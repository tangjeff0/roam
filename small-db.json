Sometimes it is synonymous with 'the mind', other times just an aspect of mind. In the past it was one's \\\"inner life\\\", the world of introspection, of private thought, imagination and volition.[5] Today, with modern research into the brain it often includes any kind of experience, [[cognition]], feeling or [[perception]]. It may be '[[awareness]]', or 'awareness of awareness', or self-awareness.[6] There might be different levels or \\\"orders\\\" of consciousness,[7] or different kinds of consciousness, or just one kind with different features.[8] Other questions include whether only humans are conscious or all animals or even the whole universe.

machine equals brain.\\\"[12] Turing replies by saying that we have no way of knowing that any individual other than ourselves experiences emotions, and that therefore we should accept the test. He adds, \\\"I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness ... [b]ut I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question [of whether machines can think].\\\" (This argument, that a computer can't have conscious experiences or understanding, would be made in 1980 by philosopher John Searle in his Chinese room argument.
